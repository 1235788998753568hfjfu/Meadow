Hello and welcome to an early version of Meadow! Meadow is a mid sized Minecraft Mod which focuses on improving and overhauling the already existing Meadow Biome. It also expands the variety of animals by adding the almost lost ones from Minecraft:Earth back. 
To get some strenght for exploring the new Biome you should definitely consider taking some Cheese with you - crafting cheese is another feature Meadow brings. Oh - and consider bringing a weapon; we heard some aggressive Brown Bears walking around there too.



## **Features** 
* A new crafting system for Cheese
* The Meadow Biome got completely overhauled. It features now some smaller building, a forest area, clearing and vegetation
* New Cows, Chickens, Bears and Sheeps…
* With new Sheeps theres also new Wool, Carpets and Beds
* You can now get Milk from Goats, Sheeps, Buffalos… Wont spoil to much!
* Lots of decorative blocks 
* New Food, Tea and more 
* New Armor
* A few new paintings featuring some popular places in switzerland 
* Tired of farming bricks for flower pots? You can craft now wooden flower pots. Coming in 2 different sizes. 
* A new type of wood
* A new type of stone
* A lot of new flowers!
* Lots of technical Blocks which will help you saving resources and time just like a Woodcutter


## **How to craft Cheese?** 
To craft Cheese you will need following Ingredients: Salt, Lab and Milk. You can find Alpine Salt everywhere underground in the new Meadow Biome. Lab can be extracted from Raw Beef, using a cooking pot and Milk… Extract it from Oat or get it from Animals such as Cows, Goats, etc. Different Milk will result in different Cheese. 


## **Where do i find all these new Type of Sheeps?** 
Flecked and Patched Sheeps can be found nearly everything where a regular Sheep will spawn too. Fuzzy Sheeps can mostly be found in Dark Forest or Birch Forest Biomes. Horned Sheeps do like cold biomes: If there is snow your chance finding a Horned Sheep will be certainly higher. Rocky Sheeps therefore can be found on rough terrain biomes. Inky Sheeps can be found in meadow biomes such as Long Nosed Sheeps. 


**Meadow requires Terrablender to work and should therefore be compatible with most WorldGen Mods such as WiliamWythersOverhauledOverworld or Terralith.**
